#### Seeding

- Create an Angular IntelliJ project
- Link to VCS (github was used initially)
- Remove .idea folder from .gitignore
- Remove  node_modules/ bower_components/ from .gitignore
 (like to track the libs; we can remove it later if needed)
- npm install (at the project root) to fetch node and bower components
 (file count of 13,000 and 100 respectively, almost 80MB total size)
